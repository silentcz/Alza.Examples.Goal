# Introduction
**Eshop Product API**
This project is a **REST API service** for an e-commerce shop, providing a set of endpoints to manage product data. The purpose of the project is to showcase production-grade practices in API design, adhering to principles like **SOLID**, **layered architecture**, and **best practices for REST API development**.
This API service provides functionality to:
- Retrieve all available products, with support for **pagination**.
- Retrieve details of a specific product by its ID.
- Partially update the description of a single product.

The API is fully documented using **Swagger** and comes with unit tests to ensure endpoint functionality. The solution leverages a **SQL Server database** for data storage, while also supporting the ability to switch easily between mock and database implementations.
